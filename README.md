# Website

Source code for my personal website at: https://teaskittle.neocities.org/ . All the websites code is written in Markdown and converted to HTML using 
pandoc. The source coded for the site is in the "md" folder. The other files
are for:

* `cnv.pl` - Converts a Markdown file into HTML and adds CSS info and a few
  other things
* `make.sh` - This runs cnv.pl on all files in the md and creates the HTML
for the entire site

## Notes

This isn't all of the websites code, I stiull need to rewrite the other
pages in Markdown, and I also do not have the image files here either. (
will add them eventually ).
