I would like to share a simple text adventure I made when I began
programming. There is a simple cli version(game.py, works on windows)
and an ncurses version(main.py, works on UNIX based OS). The ncurses
functions a bit weird, but I am not interested in working on the project
anymore so it will not be fixed. To play the ncurses version use the
number keys and \"Enter\" to select your commands, the cli version
functions with text. I hope you enjoy the game, but it is rather simple,
I am now working on a more proper text adventure in C which has actual
parsing, I will post it on this site once it\'s complete.
